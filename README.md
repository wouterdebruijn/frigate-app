# Welcome tpo the Frigate NVR App üëã
This project aims to provide a modern and friendly smartphome app for the [Frigate NVR](https://frigate.video/) project. It is built using Expo and React Native, and is available for both iOS and Android. The app is currently in development and is not yet available on the App Store or Google Play Store.

## Features
- [] View live camera feeds
- [] View recorded clips
- [] View camera events
- [] Group cameras
- [] Event notifications (push notifications)

## Requirements
The app uses the Frigate API to communicate with the Frigate NVR. You will need to have a Frigate NVR instance running and accessible from your phone. It is recommended to use a VPN or reverse proxy to secure the connection.

Live camera feeds are streamed over WebRTC, which requires aditional configuration on the Frigate NVR. Please refer to the [Frigate documentation](https://docs.frigate.video/) for more information.
